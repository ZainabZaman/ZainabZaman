## Hi there 👋
<p align="justify">
- 🔭  I am a dedicated Data Scientist with a Masters in Data Science from NUST university. I am currently working on projects in the domains of data science, image processing and natural language processing. I have hands-on experience in ML & DL models, computer vision, and Python programming. My expertise spans generative AI, ETL, and EDA. With a keen focus on multispectral and hyperspectral domains, I am committed to transforming challenges into opportunities and contributing meaningfully to the dynamic landscape of data science and artificial intelligence.
- 🌱 I'm always looking to learn and grow. Right now, I'm exploring new aspects of Hyperspectral Images (HSI) and deep learning to boost my skills for my research and career goals.
- 👯 Actively seeking collaborative opportunities with like-minded peers who share a passion for multispectral & Hyperspectral images, and unraveling the potential of visual data. 
- 📫 You can reach me through zainzam5@gmail.com to connect, collaborate, or discuss shared interests in this dynamic field.
